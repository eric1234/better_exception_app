      # The goal here is to provide error descriptions that make sense
      # to the end user. This means we use terms like "web browser"
      # instead of "client" and "page" instead of "resource". Of course
      # this makes the errors less technically correct but more friendly.
      #
      # Error messages are most useful when they are specific to the
      # issue at hand and understandable by the person receiving the
      # message. It is questionable if sending generic errors like the
      # HTTP spec provides is meaningful at all to give to an end user.
      # So try to give specific purpose-related errors if you can. But
      # if you must throw a more generic HTTP error (or are using a
      # library that is doing it for you) then we should try to have
      # error messages that mean something to the user receiving them.
      #
      # We only provide status messages for codes in the 4xx range and
      # and 5xx range (and even then status codes not likely used,
      # like 407, do not have descriptions by default). Status codes in
      # the 1xx, 2xx and 3xx range are not triggered via an exception
      # (unless your app has programmed it).
